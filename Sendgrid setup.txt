1.	Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/ and log in to your account.
2.	In the left sidebar menu, click: Settings → API Keys (not under “Email API → Integration Guide” anymore — it’s under “Settings”.) Dashboard → Settings → API Keys
3.	Click the “Create API Key” button (top right corner).
4.	Give it a name (for example: JwtAuthAppKey).
5.	Choose access level:
o	Full Access (if you’ll send emails and manage templates)
o	or Restricted Access (for production security)
6.	Click Create & View Key — it will show your new API Key.

Step 2: Verify SendGrid API key permissions
